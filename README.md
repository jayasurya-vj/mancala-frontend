Rules of Mancala

1. The game begins with one player picking up all of the pieces in any one of the pockets on his/her side.

2. Moving counter-clockwise, the player deposits one of the stones in each pocket until the stones run out

3. If you run into your own Mancala (store), deposit one piece in it. If you run into your opponent's Mancala, skip it and continue moving to the next pocket.

4. If the last piece you drop is in your own Mancala, you take another turn.

5. If the last piece you drop is in an empty pocket on your side, you capture that piece and any pieces in the pocket directly opposite.

6. Always place all captured pieces in your Mancala (store).

7. The game ends when all six pockets on one side of the Mancala board are empty.

8. Count all the pieces in each side. The winner is the player with the most pieces.
